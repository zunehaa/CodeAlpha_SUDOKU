# CodeAlpha_SUDOKU
This is a console-based Sudoku Solver built using C++, which uses backtracking to solve any valid Sudoku puzzle. You can input an incomplete 9x9 grid, and it will either solve it or inform you if a solution doesn’t exist.

# 🧩 Sudoku Solver in C++

This is a simple and efficient Sudoku Solver built using C++. The program takes an incomplete 9x9 Sudoku grid as input and uses **backtracking** to solve it.

## 📌 Features
- Solves any valid 9x9 Sudoku puzzle
- Uses backtracking algorithm
- Validates number placement
- Easy to customize and extend

## 🛠️ How It Works
The algorithm checks each empty cell in the grid and tries numbers from 1 to 9. It proceeds recursively, backtracking when a number doesn’t lead to a valid solution, until the entire grid is filled.
